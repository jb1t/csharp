This is a sample homework assignment a friend of mine received. She was supposed to do it in Python, which I did make a python version of trying to use a Linq library that I found and which took me a while to get working. However, even after I got it working the performance was not good. 

So I thought for fun I would create a .NET core application that meets the same requirements. 

The performance is great and I get to use a REAL Linq syntax. 

So this code sample really isn't all that interesting, however, I'm trying to use techniques like using Linq and Generics to make the code more resuable and maintainable.
