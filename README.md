# csharp

Most of my career has been built using Microsoft technologies. I've developed in SQL server and ASP, ASP.NET, C#, EF, WebAPI, etc... for almost 20 years. Unfortunately I at this time I don't have anything to show for it. So, my plan is to spend time in the next couple of weeks to get this section filed out with some examples of my work (obfuscated) and/or creating new side projects to show my expertise.
