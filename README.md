# csharp

Most of my career has been built using Microsoft technologies. I've developed in SQL server, ASP, ASP.NET, C#, EF, MVC, Silverlight, WebAPI, VB6, C++, etc... for almost 20 years. Unfortunately at this time I don't have much to show for it on GitHub. So, my plan is to spend time in the next couple of weeks to get this section filed out with some examples of my work (obfuscated) and/or creating new side projects to show my expertise.

## [NAppointments App](https://github.com/jb1t/csharp/tree/master/NAppointementsApp)

I'm preparing for some interviews and I was told by a HR Recruiter that in the next phase of my interviewing would be a phone/computer session where they'd ask me a question similar to something like this: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-n-appointments-find-conflicting-appointments/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-n-appointments-find-conflicting-appointments/).

So I thought today to practice I would take that [example and implement it](https://github.com/jb1t/csharp/tree/master/NAppointementsApp).
